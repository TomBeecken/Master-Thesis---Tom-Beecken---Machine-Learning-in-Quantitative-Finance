# Master Thesis - Tom Beecken - Machine Learning in Quantitative Finance

Corporate culture plays a critical role in the success and integration of organizations,
particularly during mergers and acquisitions (M&A). This dissertation aims to extract
and quantify elements of corporate culture from 10-K textual data and subsequently
apply these quantifications to real-world scenarios. To explore this question, a comprehensive
dataset consisting of 68,855 Management Discussion and Analysis sections
from10-K Filings stemming from12,553 companieswas utilized. The study employs advanced
NLP techniques, including word embedding and sentiment scoring using Term
Frequency-Inverse Document Frequency (TF-IDF), to generate a culture dictionary and
identify as well as quantify linguistic patterns indicative of corporate culture. The findings
demonstrate that NLP-driven quantification of corporate culture can provide valuable
insights for addressing cultural integration in M&A scenarios. By scoring the core
cultural values innovation, integrity, quality, respect, and teamwork, stakeholders can
make more informed decisions, potentially improving the success rates of M&A activities.
